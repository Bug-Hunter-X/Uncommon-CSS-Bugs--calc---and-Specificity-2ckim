# Uncommon CSS Bugs

This repository demonstrates two uncommon CSS bugs:

1. **`calc()` Unexpected Behavior:**  The `calc()` function can produce unexpected results due to whitespace or order of operations.
2. **Specificity Conflicts:**  Complex selectors and `!important` can make it difficult to manage CSS specificity.

The `bug.css` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected versions.
